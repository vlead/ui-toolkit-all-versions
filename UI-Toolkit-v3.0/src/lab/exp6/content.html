<p> In this experiment, we will use binary trees to represent expressions. This is
useful to Generating code for expressions which is an important part of compilers. 
Expression trees can also
be used to check for correctness of expressions. Therefore, while we can evaluate expressions
without resorting to using trees, using trees helps us in further processing of expressions.


<p> 
Here we will see another way of storing an expression, in the form of a tree, called the expression tree. An expression tree makes it easy to visualize the expression and evaluate it. An expression tree for an expression with only unary or binary operators is a binary tree where the leaf nodes are the operands and the internal nodes are the operators. We will also look at three types of tree traversals, which gives the three forms of writing an expression (Infix, Postfix and Prefix).

To generate an expression tree, given an expression, we first convert the expression to its postfix
form.
From the postfix expression, we read one symbol at a time from left to right. If the current symbol is an operand, then we push a tree of one node consisting of the operator onto a stack. If the symbol is an operator, then we pop two trees from the stack and create a tree with the root containing the operator and the result of the pop operations as the right and the left subtrees in that order. The resulting tree is again pushed onto the stack. When we have read all the symbols, the equivalent expression tree is the only element in the stack and a pop operation would give us the tree. The following example illustrates the algorithm.

Let the postfix expression be a b + f - c d * e + /.

<ul>
<li>
    When we first read 'a' and 'b' in that order and create two trees containing a single node 'a' and 'b' respectively.
</li>

<li>
     These trees are then pushed on to the stack in that order.
</li>

<li>
     When we encounter the '+' operator, we pop two trees from the stack, creating a tree with '+' as the root and the two trees as the right and the left childs respectively.
</li>

<li>
     On reading the operand 'f', we create a tree with 'f' as a single node and push it on to the stack.
</li>

<li>
     On reading a '-' we create the tree with '-' as the root and the two previously created trees as its children and push the new tree onto the stack.
</li>

<li>
     Similarly, on reading 'c' and 'd', the stack has three trees; '-' and two new trees corresponding to nodes 'c' and 'd'.
</li>

<li>
     On reading a '*', the stack has two trees; '-' and a new tree consisting of '*' as the root and 'c' and 'd' as its children.
</li>

<li>
     Continuing further, we create the tree with '+' as the root. On reading the last '/', the final tree is created.
</li>

<h3>Easy Questions</h3> 
<p> What do you obtain when doing an inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal of 
an expression tree?

<p> How can you represent a binary tree in an array? For this, you should map
each node in the binary tree to a unique position in the array. What is the 
(maximum) size of the array required to store a binary tree of n nodes.
 

<h3> Difficult Questions</h3>
<p> Given an inorder traversal sequence, how many different trees can you draw that have the 
same inorder traversal?

<p> Answer the above question for preorder traversal, and separately for the postorder
traversal.

<p> How does your answer to the above question change if you are given both the inorder
traversal and the preorder traversal? How many trees exist that has the given inorder
traversal sequence and the given preorder traversal sequence.

<p> Based on your answer to the previous question, write a program that takes as input
an inorder traversal sequence and a preorder traversal sequence, and outputs a binary
tree that has the given inorder and preorder traversal.

<h3> Tree Traversals</h3>
<p> Another related topic is that of tree traversals.
Tree traversal is a technique of listing the nodes in a tree. Let us restrict our attention to binary trees.Consider a recursive definition of a binary tree as having a root, a left (right) sub-binary tree whose root is the left(right) child of the root node. To list all the nodes in the tree, it is required to list the root node, all the nodes in the left subtree, and all the nodes in the right subtree. Denoting by D as the name of the root node, and by L (R) the node names in the left (right) subtree, we have the following choices.We could arrange D, L, and R in any order. Thus, there are six choices. However, if we keep the convention that nodes in R are listed only after nodes in L, then we have three choices: DLR, LDR, and RLD. The first choice is called as prefix traversal, the second as infix, and the third as the postfix traversal.<br>
Procedure Inorder(T)<br>
begin<br>
if T != NULL then<br>
begin<br>
Inorder(T-> left);<br>
PrintElement(T-> data);<br>
Inorder(T-> right);<br>
end<br>
End.<br>
In preorder traversal, the contents of the root are printed before its subtrees in the left and right order.<br>
Procedure Preorder(T)<br>
begin<br>
if T != NULL then<br>
begin<br>
PrintElement(T-> data);<br>
Preorder(T-> left);<br>
Prorder(T-> right);<br>
end<br>
End.<br>
The postorder traversal visits the left and the right subtrees first before visiting the contents of the root.<br>
Procedure Postorder(T)<br>
begin<br>
if T != NULL then<br>
begin<br>
Postorder(T-> left);<br>
Postorder(T-> right);<br>
PrintElement(T-> data);<br>
end<br>
End.<br>

Notice that the inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of an expression tree have appropriate meanings.

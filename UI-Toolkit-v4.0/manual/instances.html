<h2>
	Hierarchical Structure: Instances
</h2>

<p>
Each node in the hierarchical structure is called an <b>Instance</b>. Each 
instance in the hierarchical structure is shown as a node under the world title.
The ﬁnal instance in the list of instances under world title is the complete 
hierarchical model. An instance consists of three sections and two options.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<b>Coordinate system</b> 
	- This is the local coordinate system of the instance relative to the 
	parent instance. The editable options in the coordinate system are:
	<ul>
		<li>
		X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis - Axis vectors for the corresponding axis.
		</li>
		<li>
		Origin - Location of origin for this coordinate system. The three axis vectors above emerge from the origin.
		</li>
		<li>
		Axes size - Length of axes displayed
		</li>
		<li>
		Show units - Enable to display the units when tracking a vertex of the current instance.
		</li>
		<li>
		Draw - Enable/Disable the visibility of the coordinate system in the canvas.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Shape / Instance</b> 
	- These could be shapes if the current instance is a leaf node or other 
	instances if the current instance is an intermediate node or could be a 
	set of shapes and instances.
	<ul>
		<li>
		Shapes have Vertices which can be edited and the tracking 
		enabled/disabled for each individual vertex. Any vertex can be 
		selected by clicking on it. Shapes could also have Triangles 
		which is a list of triplets each representing a triangle with 
		the values of the triplets being indices of vertices that form 
		the triangle. These again can be edited by clicking on any 
		value.
		</li>
		<li>
		Instance is again a new node with all the features explained 
		here.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Transformation</b> 
	- This has a list of transformations applied to the shapes and 
	instances above in the local coordinate system. The order of 
	transformation can be modiﬁed. More transformations can be added, 
	edited or deleted. The duration setting for each transformation is the 
	number of frames in which the transformation is animated from the frame 
	speciﬁed as start frame.
	<ul>
		<li>
		Translate does a translation of the above mentioned shapes and 
		instances in the local coordinate system. This could be 
		animated from no translation to the speciﬁed translation.
		</li>
		<li>
		Rotate does a rotation of the shapes and instances about the 
		speciﬁed axis or any custom vector by the speciﬁed angle in the 
		local coordinate system. This could be animated from zero 
		rotation angle to the speciﬁed rotation angle.
		</li>
		<li>
		Scale does a scaling on the shapes and instances by the 
		speciﬁed ratio along the speciﬁed axis in the local coordinate 
		system. This could be animated from zero scale to the speciﬁed 
		scale.
		</li>
		<li>
		Animation of each transformation could be set by specifying the 
		number of frames over which the animation is done in the 
		duration input. Starting frame for the animation can be 
		speciﬁed in the Starting frame input in the transformation 
		window.
		</li>
		<li>
		Order of the transformation can be modiﬁed by selecting the 
		transformation and clicking the move up button in the window 
		showing the list of transformations.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Active</b> 
	- This option speciﬁes whether the current instance is highlighted in 
	the canvas.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Draw</b> 
	- Enable/Disable the visibility of the current instance (along with the 
	child instances) in the canvas.
	</li>
</ol>

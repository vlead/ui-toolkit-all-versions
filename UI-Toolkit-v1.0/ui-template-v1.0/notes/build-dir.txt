help: 
  contains this documentation on how to use the
  UI framework

lab:

  all the source files for the lab are here.
  index.html and default.html should be
  untouched.  You should edit only the file
  content.html in the current and the exp1
  directory.  You may want to create your own
  exp directories but make sure you copy the
  index.html and default.html from the given
  exp1 directory.

  In addition, the lab directory contains js,
  images, and css directories.  These
  directories are there to hold your own custom
  files.

lib: 

  All the library files (like MathJax, jQuery,
  modernizr) are in this directory.

themes:

  Two themes are supplied with this release.

  * maroon-grid (uses iiith style, which does
    not display icons)

  * blue-icon (uses the iitb style, which uses
    icons for sections)

  Of course, you are free to design your own
  theme, and place it in the themes folder.


makefile:

  This file is used for building a release
  (described below).


Building a release
==================

The build is the final deliverable of the lab's
content.  To create a build, you need to cd to
the directory containing the makefile and run
the command

  make -k theme=<theme-name>

   * maroon-grid
   * blue-icon
   * <your-own-theme>, if you create one


  or, the command 

      make -k  

  which uses the default theme blue-icon.  

  The first time around, the build will take a
  long time, because it copies the MathJax
  directory.  The next time around, it shouldn't
  take that long.  

     make clean

  will clean the build directory (but keep the
  js directory intact)


Structure of the build directory
================================

build/
   theme-<theme-name>
   content.html
   default.html
   index.html
   exp1/
